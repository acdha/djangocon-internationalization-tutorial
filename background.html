                    The easiest way to spend less time dealing with complex
                    data is not to ask for it: do you really need to know your
                    users' gender? This is also a good way to avoid your signup
                    process feeling nosy
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you do need data, ask how much structure you need: a
                    simple “What name should we display on your profile?” field
                    is easy to build and much easier than trying to migrate a
                    simplistic system after it's full of user data
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you have to model something complicated, pay the cost
                    upfront: use a library or service, test major assumptions
                    and potential outliers regularly and think about how you'll
                    deal with problems

            <p>
                When people started building electronic communication systems,
                it was easy to continue assigning each distinct character a
                number. Since early systems needed to be simple each character
                was assigned a fixed-length binary number
            </p>

                    (1870) to ITA2 (1930): 5 bits - just enough for the English alphabet

                    (1928): 6 bits allowed punctuation. Unfortunately,
                    different manufacturers used different schemes, making it
                    difficult to exchange data or even mix computers and
                    printers from different manufacturers!

                    7 bits allow both upper <em>and</em> lower case!
                    Standardization should also help avoid painful conversion
                    issues between manufacturers…

                <li class="slide">
                    <p>… but almost everyone outside the United States needs
                    more characters and uses 8-bits to store extended
                    characters beyond basic ASCII. Worse, it's frequently
                    possible to exchange text incorrectly until someone notices
                    the first document using one of the different
                    characters!</p>

                    <p>Since there are individual languages which need more
                    than 256 characters, there's no possibility of a standard
                    8-bit encoding emerging</p>

                    <p>Unicode provides rules to determine when characters are
                    exactly the same (e.g. U+00F1 = U+006E + U+0303 = ñ) and also
                    when they are functionally the same (e.g. "&#xFB00;" == "ff" for

                <dd>
                    Various alphabets (Latin, Georgian, Armenian, Cyrillic,
                    etc.) have the concept of “case” and Unicode has rules for
                    converting text from one case to another, including the
                    various language-specific complications this can entail:
                    for example, the German ß (SMALL LETTER SHARP S) converts
                    to uppercase as “SS”

                    (see <cite><a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr21/tr21-5.html">Unicode Standard Annex #21: CASE MAPPINGS</a></cite>).
                </dd>

                <dt>Case Folding</dt>
                <dd>
                    Case folding is a similar process, generally used for
                    caseless comparisons (e.g. search). In Unicode this is
                    an expanded form of the lowercase mapping which is
                    consistent but the output is not suitable for display to
                    users

            <h2>Unicode Encodings</h2>

            <p>
                The Unicode standard describes abstract characters but we need
                a way to convert them into bytes for storage and exchange.
                Early experiments which simply doubled 8-bit ASCII to 16-bits
                revealed significant problems:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Not every processor stores the bytes comprising a 16-bit
                    integer the same way — big-endian (“UNIX”) or little-endian
                    (“NUXI”) — necessitating a special byte-order mark (BOM) at
                    the start of the string simply to decode it
                </li>
                <li><strong>All</strong> existing text would need to be converted!</li>
                <li>All text becomes more expensive to store and process</li>
                <li>It wasn't enough: Chinese alone would require at least 3 bytes!</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                UTF-8 was developed to avoid these problems. It's
                <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629#page-4">a very
                clever variable-length encoding scheme</a> under which all
                existing 7-bit ASCII is valid, all common non-Asian characters
                require only 2 bytes, common CJK still needs only 3-bytes,
                using 4 bytes only for rare and historical characters. Because
                it's read one byte at a time, there's no need for a BOM.

            <p>
                We previously discussed how accented characters can be formed
                by combining a base character with the desired diacritic. The
                concept of multiple characters producing a visually distinct
                glyph is relatively unusual in English, where only a few
                ligatures are at all commonly used - perhaps the best known
                being the “ae” in encylopædia - but other languages depend on
                this behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>
                A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_text_layout">complex text layout</a>
                system allows the visual display to be significantly altered
                based on the context. If you need to support complex languages
                this will affect your font choices and design options!
